# Local Development

The `dev` command runs your agent locally for testing before deployment.

## Starting the Dev Server

```bash
# Start dev server (auto-selects agent if only one)
agentcore dev

# Specify agent
agentcore dev --runtime MyAgent

# Custom port
agentcore dev --port 3000

# Non-interactive mode (logs to stdout)
agentcore dev --logs
```

## Invoking Local Agents

Start the dev server in one terminal, then send prompts from another:

```bash
# Terminal 1: start the dev server
agentcore dev --logs

# Terminal 2: send prompts
agentcore dev "What can you do?"
agentcore dev "Tell me a story" --stream
agentcore dev "Hello" --runtime MyAgent
```

## Environment Setup

### Python Virtual Environment

The dev server automatically:

1. Creates `.venv` if it doesn't exist
2. Runs `uv sync` to install dependencies from `pyproject.toml`
3. Starts uvicorn with your agent

### TypeScript Agents

TypeScript agents (Strands-only) use Node 22 and `tsx` for the dev loop:

1. Runs `npm install` on first scaffold to populate `node_modules/` from `package.json`
2. Starts the agent with `npx tsx watch main.ts` — file changes reload automatically
3. No compile step is required; `tsx` executes `.ts` sources directly

Set `AGENTCORE_SKIP_INSTALL=1` to skip `npm install` if you want to manage dependencies yourself.

### Java Agents

Java agents use `MvnDevServer`, detected by `pom.xml` under the runtime's `codeLocation`; it runs `mvn spring-boot:run`
with `AWS_REGION` passed through and does not provide hot reload.

Install Java 21 and Maven 3.9 or later. The dev server passes the selected local port through `SERVER_PORT` and `PORT`.
Restart the server after source changes. See [Spring AI (Java)](frameworks.md#spring-ai-java) for the supported matrix.

### API Keys

For non-Bedrock providers, add keys to `agentcore/.env.local`:

```bash
AGENTCORE_CREDENTIAL_{projectName}OPENAI=sk-...
AGENTCORE_CREDENTIAL_{projectName}ANTHROPIC=sk-ant-...
AGENTCORE_CREDENTIAL_{projectName}GEMINI=...
```

## Debugging

### Log Files

Logs are written to `agentcore/.cli/logs/`:

```
agentcore/.cli/logs/
├── dev/           # Dev server logs
└── invoke/        # Invocation logs with request/response
```

### Verbose Output

```bash
# Dev server with stdout logging
agentcore dev --logs
```

### Common Issues

**Port already in use:**

```bash
agentcore dev --port 8081
```

**Missing dependencies:**

```bash
cd app/MyAgent
uv sync
```

## Hot Reload

The dev server watches for file changes and automatically reloads for Python and TypeScript agents. Java agents do not
provide hot reload; restart the Maven dev server after source changes.

### Container Agents

For non-Java container agents, the dev server builds a Docker image and runs it with your source directory mounted as a
volume. Changes are picked up by the language-specific reload process inside the container, so no image rebuild is
needed. Java agents use the native Maven dev loop above.

See [Container Builds](container-builds.md) for full details on container development.

## Dev vs Deployed Behavior

| Aspect     | Local Dev                    | Deployed                   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| API Keys   | `.env.local`                 | AgentCore Identity service |
| Memory     | Not available                | AgentCore Memory service   |
| Gateways   | Env vars from deployed state | CDK-injected env vars      |
| Networking | localhost                    | Public                     |

Memory requires deployment to test fully. For local testing, you can mock these dependencies in your agent code.

## Gateway Environment Variables

When you have deployed gateways, `agentcore dev` automatically injects gateway environment variables into your local
agent process. This lets your local agent connect to real deployed gateways during development.

The dev server reads `deployed-state.json` and `agentcore.json` to generate:

```bash
AGENTCORE_GATEWAY_{NAME}_URL=https://{gateway-id}.gateway.agentcore.{region}.amazonaws.com
AGENTCORE_GATEWAY_{NAME}_AUTH_TYPE=NONE|AWS_IAM|CUSTOM_JWT
```

The gateway name is uppercased with hyphens replaced by underscores. For example, a gateway named `my-gateway` produces:

```bash
AGENTCORE_GATEWAY_MY_GATEWAY_URL=https://...
AGENTCORE_GATEWAY_MY_GATEWAY_AUTH_TYPE=NONE
```

### Requirements

Gateway env vars require a prior deployment — the dev server reads the gateway URLs from `deployed-state.json`, which is
populated by `agentcore deploy`. If you haven't deployed yet, no gateway env vars will be set.

### Workflow

```bash
# 1. Add a gateway and target
agentcore add gateway --name my-gateway
agentcore add gateway-target --name my-tools --type mcp-server \
  --endpoint https://mcp.example.com/mcp --gateway my-gateway

# 2. Deploy to create the gateway
agentcore deploy -y

# 3. Run locally — gateway env vars are injected automatically
agentcore dev
```

Your agent code reads these env vars to connect to the gateway. The agent templates generated by the CLI already include
this wiring.

Spring AI Java agents support only `AWS_IAM` gateways. See [Spring AI (Java)](frameworks.md#spring-ai-java) for the
supported gateway boundary; generic `NONE` and `CUSTOM_JWT` gateway environment values do not make those authorizers
available to Java agents.
